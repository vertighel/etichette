Simple Form to add text elements to an svg image, inspired by a  [http://bl.ocks.org/duopixel/3831266](duopixel example).
The number of the elements are defined by a simple text array.
The text of the array elements will be used to set IDs and classes.

Clicking on the link will download the svg image (tested on Chromium, Firefox and Opera).
